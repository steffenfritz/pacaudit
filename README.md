# pacaudit

pacaudit audits installed packages on Arch Linux against known vulnerabilities listed on https://security.archlinux.org

It ships with a preInstall hook for pacman that warns you if you try to install a vulnerable package.

You can also check your local installation against offline vulnerability data. This is useful for systems without web access. Check the man page for more information.
